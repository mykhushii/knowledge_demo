Artificial Intelligence software, by the leading artificial intelligence companies, is a fast-growing market within computer science that focuses on creating and providing intelligent problem-solving solutions. A.I. software can include speech recognition, problem-solving, learning and planning that can aid or even replace human engagement in a process.

Artificial Intelligence is the broader concept of machines being able to carry out tasks in a way that we would consider “smart”. Machine Learning is a current application of AI based around the idea that we should really just be able to give machines access to data and let them learn for themselves. Google CEO Sundar Pichai says artificial intelligence is going to have a bigger impact on the world than some of the most ubiquitous innovations in history. Tesla is using advanced AI for vision and planning, supported by efficient use of inference hardware to achieve a general solution to full self-driving.
